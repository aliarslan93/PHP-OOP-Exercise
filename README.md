# What is Object-Oriented Programming?

It is a programming language model. It was put forward to provide functionality on objects and objects.

1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction

Each object is an instance of a class or subclass, containing methods or procedures and data variables.

<h1>Encapsulation</h1>
It's a general concept and definitions are <b>public</b>, <b>protected</b> and <b>private</b> .

1. Public => Everyone access and change this object model.
2. Protected => This object model more secure than "public object model" and that can access on where it was created but doesn't changeable.
3. Private => More secure object model and only shown where it was created
<h1>Inheritance</h1>

1. <b>Single Inheritance</b> (Subclass can get  only a class's properties.)
2. <b>Multiple Inheritance</b> (A subclass has all the properties of more than one superclass.)
3. <b>Multilevel Inheritance</b> (After created a subclass of a class, it is called creating a subclass of that subclass.)
4. <b>Hierarchical Inheritance</b> (It is called base class (base class) of a superclass to more than one subclass.)
5. <b>Hybrid Inheritance</b> (It is an Inheritance type that contains 2 or more of the other Inheritance types.)
<h1>Polymorphism</h1>
This is the feature of the model in the OOP that indicates its ability to handle different types of data and classes differently.
<h1>Abstraction</h1>
An abstract superclass is created if it is desired to create a superclass that has the common features and functions of subclasses but does not yet have an object.
